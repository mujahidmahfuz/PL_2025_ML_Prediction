**Predicting the 2025/26 Premier League season using a Random Classifier**

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and season CSV datasets used to build a (baseline) random classifier that predicts match outcomes / season-related results for the 2025/26 Premier League season. The original repository files and notebook are hosted here. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Project Overview

This project is a simple baseline ML exercise: using historic English Premier League season data (CSV files included) and a random classifier as a baseline to predict outcomes for the upcoming 2025/26 season. It demonstrates dataset loading, basic preprocessing, model training/evaluation (baseline), and a notebook-driven workflow. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
